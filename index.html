	<br />Water is one the most important resources to regular life. 
	However, due to Climate change, water supplies are dwindling. 
	As populaion and demand for fresh water grows, fresh water will decrease. 
	The ocean is majority of Earth's water supply. 
	However, it is also tainted with different minerals, like salt, that makes it insificient for usage. 
	If society came up with a suffiecient way of taking out the salt in ocean water, we'd have a supply that is almost infinite. 
	There are few methods to this problem that exists. There is Water Disitlltion, Reverse Osmosis, and Electrodialysis.

	This site is to educate those who wish to learn how this is possible. We will be providing simulations and video guidlines to help you understand the methods for water desalination.
