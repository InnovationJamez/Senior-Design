		My major is computer engineering. I have a great amount of experience in creating interactive web aplications and I am happy to apply those skills to teaching people about desalination and electrodialysis.

I am a graduating senior at Wentworth Institute of Technology. I am graduating with a major in computer engineering and a minor in physics. 
	
	Some skills I have picked up involve coding languages like C++ and Java. Along with markup languages like HTML and CSS. With that said, I am more than happy to use what I've learned to help teach others.
